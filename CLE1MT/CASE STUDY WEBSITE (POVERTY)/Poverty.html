    	<h1>Introduction on Poverty</h1>
    	<p><b><h3>"Poverty is the state of having few material possessions or little income. Poverty can have diverse social, economic, and political causes and effects."</p></h3></b>

    	<p>The Philippines has a fairly high poverty rate with more than 16% of the population living below the poverty line. Because of the many people reliant on agriculture for an income and inequality in wealth distribution, about 17.6 million Filipinos struggle to afford basic necessities.</p>
    	<p>Data indicates that 16.6% of the population of the Philippines, or about 17.6 million people, live under the poverty line. Those who reside in rural areas have a much higher chance of experiencing poverty, with nearly one-third of those under the poverty line working as farmers.</p>

		Image result for poverty in the philippines
		high inflation during crisis periods; high levels of population growth; high and persistent levels of inequality (incomes and assets), which dampen the positive impacts of economic expansion; and. recurrent shocks and exposure to risks such as economic crisis, conflicts, natural disasters,and "environmental poverty."</p>

		<p>Poverty entails more than the lack of income and productive resources to ensure sustainable livelihoods. Its manifestations include hunger and malnutrition, limited access to education and other basic services, social discrimination and exclusion as well as the lack of participation in decision-making.</p>

		<p>Poverty is linked with negative conditions such as substandard housing, homelessness, inadequate nutrition and food insecurity, inadequate child care, lack of access to health care, unsafe neighborhoods, and underresourced schools which adversely impact our nation's children.</p>
